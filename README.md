# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect Element Selection

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML where the JavaScript code incorrectly selects an element, resulting in unintended consequences. The intended behavior is to hide a specific div element, but due to the incorrect selector, it might hide other divs or elements unexpectedly, affecting the layout and visibility of the page.

The `bug.html` file showcases the flawed code, while `solution.html` provides the corrected version.

This type of error can be tricky to debug because it may not immediately throw errors, making it a hard-to-find bug in larger projects.
